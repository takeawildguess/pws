      <description>I am passionate about AI. In 2015, I got a PhD degree in Energetics at Politecnico di Torino. My work mainly focused on developing a simulation environment for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles and Hybrid Powertrain Optimal Control. As post-doc researcher at Polito, my current goal is to develop machine learning algorithms for advance vehicle control, exploiting Vehicle-to-Infrastructure data.
My focus is on the study of energy consumption, CO2 emissions and costs of Plug-in Hybrid Electric vehicles and Full Electric Vehicles.</description>

      <description>This is my personal website where I will be publishing the main findings and outcomes of some small side-projects that I develop in my spare time. The overall scope of this project is to develop and describe what it could be necessary to create some “smart agents”. As agent, I literally mean someone/something that is capable of performing a task in a particular environment. Being smart entails to achieve the final goal in a remarkable way.</description>
