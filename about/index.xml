      <description>I am passionate about AI and I have been developing some applications that could benefit from this new technique.
One of the first areas I started investigating the AI potential was my PhD research field. My work mainly focused on developing a simulation environment for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles and Hybrid Powertrain Optimal Control. After completing it in 2015, my goal as post-doc researcher was to develop machine learning algorithms for advance vehicle control, exploiting Vehicle-to-Infrastructure data.</description>

      <description>This is my personal website where I will be publishing the main findings and outcomes of some research side-projects that I develop in my spare time. The overall scope of this project is to develop and describe what could be necessary to create some “smart agents”. As an agent, I literally mean someone/something that is capable of performing a task in a particular environment. Being smart entails achieving the final goal in a remarkable way.</description>
