      <description>1. Introduction This post belongs to a new series of posts where I intend to face the challenge of learning a new programming language, such as Python, by doing. In the first two posts (Part1 and Part2), we develop a Python code from scratch to determine the travelled distance of a bike rider in a given time span, for a fixed and increasing annual distance target. We started to play with some text processing tasks in Part3.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction This post belongs to a new series of posts where I intend to face the challenge of learning a new programming language, such as Python, by doing. There are tons of material about Python tutorials for every level of expertise. It has been quite a while now that platforms such as codewars, topcoders and similar have been around. The nice thing that I like about these platforms is that the trainee is faced with many tasks or challenges of increasing difficulty.</description>
