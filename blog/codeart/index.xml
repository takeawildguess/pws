      <description>1. Introduction This post belongs to the code art series, where art is built with code. The previous post and this one will aim at defining a function to create a geometric pattern, a spirograph pattern in a rectangle, inspired by this video, with Python libraries.
We will follow these steps:
 Grid definition, parametric equation of the rectangle in Part1. Polygon vertex detection, postprocessing of intersection points, colour scheme definition, global function implementation and final drawings in Part2.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction This post belongs to a new series of posts where I intend to face the challenge of drawing both static and dynamic pictures with a programming language. This practice is commonly referred to as code art, where art is built with code.

One of the most popular languages I have seen so far to create some code art is Javascript, but I wish to investigate how Python libraries to reach the same goal.</description>
