      <description>1. Introduction This post belongs to a new series of posts related to a huge and popular topic in machine learning: fully connected neural networks.
The general series scope is three-fold:
 visualize the model features and characteristics with schematic pictures and charts learn to implement the model with different levels of abstraction, given by the framework used have some fun with one of the hottest topics right now!  In this new post, we are going to analyze how to train a neural network on toy examples with Keras.</description>
