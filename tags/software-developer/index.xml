      <description>I am passionate about AI. In 2015, I got a PhD degree in Energetics at Politecnico di Torino. My work mainly focused on developing a simulation environment for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles and Hybrid Powertrain Optimal Control. As post-doc researcher at Polito, my current goal is to develop machine learning algorithms for advance vehicle control, exploiting Vehicle-to-Infrastructure data.
My focus is on the study of energy consumption, CO2 emissions and costs of Plug-in Hybrid Electric vehicles and Full Electric Vehicles.</description>
