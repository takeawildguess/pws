      <description>1. Problem formulation We want to create a simplified representation (model) of real/world from available data. The model architecture can be seen as a box that takes some quantities as input, performs some internal computation and returns some other quantities as output. The inputs are also referred to as features or predictors of the problem to solve, since they contain valuable information that the model should exploit to come up with the correct outcome.</description>
